== Holon Platform Documentation and learning

=== About the documentation

The Holon Platform reference guide is available as link:{docsurl}/{revnumber}/reference[HTML] and  link:{docsurl}/{revnumber}/reference/pdf/holon-platform.pdf[PDF] documents. The latest documentation version is available at link:{docsurl}/current/reference.

Each platform *module* is shipped with its own documentation, which can be accessed and downloaded independently. See the <<modules>> section for the available modules list and their documentation resources.

TIP: The Holon Platform is open source, including the documentation. If you find problems with the documentation resources or if you just want to improve them, please link:https://github.com/holon-platform/platform[get involved].

=== Examples and tutorials

A list of *tutorials* about the Holon Platform is available link:https://holon-platform.com/tutorials[here]. 

See link:https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-examples[github.com/holon-platform/holon-examples] for a rich set of *example* projects.

== Getting started

=== Introducing the Holon Platform

*TODO* The introduction goes here.

=== System Requirements

The Holon Platform {revnumber} requires https://www.java.com[Java 8] or above. Explicit build support is provided for link:https://maven.apache.org[Maven] (3+).

=== Release notes

The releases of each platform module and of the platform itself are tracked in the GitHub repositories. Each *release tag* provides a link to the list of the closed issues, including bug fixes and enhancements. 

For the platform distribution project, the release informations can be found at link:https://github.com/holon-platform/platform/releases[github.com/holon-platform/platform/releases].

=== Platform distribution versioning

.

=== Obtain the platform artifacts

The Holon Platform uses link:https://maven.apache.org[Maven] to build and distribute the platform artifacts, using the `com.holon-platform` base *group id*.

All the production *releases* (including binaries, sources and javadocs) are hosted in the likn:https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central[Maven Central] repository.

The easiest way to obtain the Holon Platform artifacts is by using the platform *BOM (Bill Of Materials)*, which provides a complete set of dependencies of the latest release of each module. The Maven coordinates of the platform *BOM* are:

_Platform BOM Maven coordinates_:
[source, xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
<groupId>com.holon-platform</groupId>
<artifactId>bom</artifactId>
<version>{revnumber}</version>
----

The *BOM* can be imported an used in a Maven project in the following way:

[source, xml, subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes+"]
----
<project>

<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.holon-platform</groupId>
			<artifactId>bom</artifactId>
			<version>{revnumber}</version>
			*<type>pom</type>*
			*<scope>import</scope>*
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

With the platform *BOM* imported in your dependency management section, you can declare and obtain the artifacts you need without specifying the artifact version, which will be the latest version provided by the platform bom. For example:

[source, xml]
----
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.holon-platform.core</groupId>
		<artifactId>holon-core</artifactId>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>

</project>
----

See the <<modules>> section for detailed informations about each module's artifacts.

==== Pre-releases

The platform *pre-releases* are hosted in the link:https://bintray.com/holon-platform/pre-releases[Holon Platform pre-releases Bintray repository]. 

To obtain a pre-release artifact you need to add the following repository specification either in link:https://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Repositories[settings.xml] or in your link:https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html[pom.xml]:

[source, xml]
