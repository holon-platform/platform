== Holon Platform Documentation and learning

=== About the documentation

The Holon Platform reference guide is available as **HTML** and  **PDF** documents. The latest documentation version is available at link:https://docs.holon-platform.com/current/reference[https://docs.holon-platform.com/current/reference].

Each platform *module* is shipped with its own documentation, which can be accessed and downloaded independently. See the <<modules>> section for the available modules list and their documentation resources.

TIP: The Holon Platform is open source, including the documentation. If you find problems with the documentation resources or if you just want to improve them, please link:https://github.com/holon-platform/platform[get involved].

=== Getting help and report bugs

Besides this reference guide, for more advanced topics or if you have troubles with the Holon Platform, we'd like to help and support you:

* Ask a question on link:https://stackoverflow.com[stackoverflow.com]. We monitor questions tagged with `holon-platform`.
* Report bugs at link:https://github.com/holon-platform/platform/issues[github.com/holon-platform/platform/issues]. See the <<modules>> section to report bugs for a specific platform module.

== Getting started

=== Introducing the Holon Platform

The Holon Platform is a Java development ecosystem to create and maintain high quality, enteprise-grade web applications and services.

Some main platform key points are:

* *Provides "real" Java API*: the Holon platform is designed as a real Java API, with the aim to leverage all new Java 8 features and to create strong abstraction layers to ensure implementation details encapsulation, high productivity and long-term maintanability with a minimal application upgrade effort to follow the platform evolution.

* It's *modular and full-stack* at the same time: the Holon platform provides a full-stack application development environment, but you can select only the components or modules you need and replace or extend them leveraging on the high configurability and extensibility features ensured by the platform architecture.

* The *`Property` data model*: the Holon platform property data model architecture allows to use an application data model which is independent from the persistence technology and make it a shared asset for all application layers, from the backend to the UI, avoiding code duplication and using a consistent API to manage it.

* It's *extensible by design*: the Holon platform components are designed to be highly extensible, configurable and integrable with other frameworks or libraries. This way it is the platform which must fit your needs, and not vice-versa.

The platform is organized in *modules*: each module corresponds to a GitHub repository and it is composed by a number of _artifacts_.

All the modules depends from the _core_ module, and any other module (and its _artifacts_) can be used independently, to suit each project/application needs with a lightweight dependency set.

See the <<modules>> section of the documentation for a list of all available modules.

=== System Requirements

The Holon Platform {revnumber} requires https://www.java.com[Java 8] or above. Explicit build support is provided for link:https://maven.apache.org[Maven] (3+).

=== Release notes

The releases of each platform module and of the platform itself are tracked in the GitHub repositories. Each *release tag* provides a link to the list of the closed issues, including bug fixes and enhancements. 

For the platform distribution project, the release informations can be found at link:https://github.com/holon-platform/platform/releases[github.com/holon-platform/platform/releases].

=== Platform distribution versioning

The Holon platform use the link:http://semver.org[Semantic Versioning] system. 

Each platform *module* is versioned following the semantic versioning convention.

The platform distribution artifact, which contains the Maven *BOM (Bill Of Materials)* to provide all the platform modules artifacts (see below), is bound to all the latest modules version at the platform release time. For this reason, the following convention is used for the platform distribution versioning:

* When a new platform *module* version is released, a new platform distribution version is released too, and the platform overall version is incremented according to the *module* version: if it is a _patch version_ release, the platform _patch version_ is incremented; if it is a _minor version_ release, the platform _minor version_ is incremented instead.

* When more than one platform *module* version changes, the most significative version change is taken into account: if the _minor version_ of a module is changed, the platform _minor version_ is incremented; if only the _patch version_ of the modules is changed, the platform _patch version_ is incremented instead.

* The platform _major version_ number is incremented for breaking and not backward-compatible API changes. In this case, all the platform *modules* will be versioned with the new  _major version_ number.

* The platform _patch version_ number can be incremented even if there are not any module version changes, for example to release a documentation or BOM project fix.

=== Obtain the platform artifacts

The Holon Platform uses link:https://maven.apache.org[Maven] to build and distribute the platform artifacts, using the `com.holon-platform` base *group id*.

All the production *releases* (including binaries, sources and javadocs) are hosted in the link:https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central[Maven Central] repository.

The easiest way to obtain the Holon Platform artifacts is by using the platform *BOM (Bill Of Materials)*, which provides a complete set of dependencies of the latest release of each module. The Maven coordinates of the platform *BOM* are:

_Platform BOM Maven coordinates_:
[source, xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
<groupId>com.holon-platform</groupId>
<artifactId>bom</artifactId>
<version>{revnumber}</version>
----

The *BOM* can be imported an used in a Maven project in the following way:

[source, xml, subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes+"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.holon-platform</groupId>
			<artifactId>bom</artifactId>
			<version>{revnumber}</version>
			*<type>pom</type>*
			*<scope>import</scope>*
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

With the platform *BOM* imported in your dependency management section, you can declare and obtain the artifacts you need without specifying the artifact version, which will be the latest version provided by the platform bom. For example:

[source, xml]
----
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.holon-platform.core</groupId>
		<artifactId>holon-core</artifactId>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
----

See the <<modules>> section for detailed informations about each module's artifacts.

==== Pre-releases

The platform *pre-releases* are hosted in the link:https://bintray.com/holon-platform/pre-releases[Holon Platform pre-releases Bintray repository]. 

To obtain a pre-release artifact you need to add the following repository specification either in link:https://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Repositories[settings.xml] or in your link:https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html[pom.xml]:

[source, xml]
----
<repositories>
    <!-- ... -->
   <repository>
    <id>holon-platform-pre-releases</id>
    <name>Holon Platform pre-releases</name>
    <url>http://dl.bintray.com/holon-platform/pre-releases</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
----

=== Spring and Spring Boot integration

The Holon Platform provides a wide integration with the link:https://spring.io[Spring Framework] and link:http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot].

A set of `Enable*` type annotation are available for a quick and simple configuration of the most common and useful _Spring-enabled_ platform components.

Besides, a complete and powerful set of _Spring Boot_ *auto-configuration* classes and *starters* are provided for each platform module.

See each module specific documentation for available Spring and Spring Boot configuration helpers and resources.
